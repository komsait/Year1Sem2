Students will learn about database systems and their applications in both daily life and the workplace in this course. The course's main goal is to give students the information and abilities they need to construct databases, particularly during the conceptual and logical database design phase. Database design, entity connection diagrams, normalization, database environment, and structured query language (SQL) are some of the subjects covered. The use of a database management system (DBMS) will be taught to the students. Using the methods they have studied, a database management system, and a development tool, students must design and create the database component of an information system. Students should be able to apply their understanding of creating and developing a good database system.
