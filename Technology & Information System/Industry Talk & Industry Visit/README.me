<h1 align="center">Reflection on Industrial Talk and Visits</h1>

One of the key ways that the theoretical knowledge and its practical implementations in the professional area have been bridged is through industrial talks and visits. The talks emphasized the critical role that data engineering plays in the ICT industry and the importance of acquiring soft skills in order to pursue a successful career. Immersion tours of the Huawei Innovation Center, UTM Digital, and Petronas gave participants first-hand knowledge of how these companies use technology to run their businesses.

These encounters acted as potent reminders of the value of lifelong learning, skillful problem-solving, and flexibility in the face of rapidly changing technology environments. The presenters' priceless advice and insights broadened my perspective and improved my understanding, creating a strong link between scholarly ideas and the common sense applications in the industry. This exposure has significantly bolstered my readiness to tackle future professional challenges.
