This course's primary goal is to give students a systematic methodology-based practical approach to systems analysis and design. Students can thus study information system requirements for any system application within an organizational environment thanks to this course. Directly from the steps of planning, analysis, designing, and implementation, the contents are arranged in a sequential order. The planning and analysis phase's final product will give students the tools to create input, output, and interface designs. Thus, a design prototype can be shown.
