An advanced C++ course that focuses on the concepts of object-oriented programming, or OOP, is called Programming Technique II. PT2 covers advanced subjects including inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL), building on knowledge of foundational programming. As they study concurrency, memory management, and design patterns, they become proficient in building scalable, effective software systems. Students' problem-solving abilities are strengthened via hands-on activities and projects, which also equip them for real-world software development issues.
